# ELEMWAVE PAGE DEPLOYMENT
In order to deploy a public web site using GitHub pages we have to follow these steps:

1. First of all we have to create a repository where we will keep our web site configuration and code (It has to be public if you want to use the free version of Git pages).

2. Once we have our web page ready to deploy and saved on our repository we will have to go to the “Repository settings”.

3. Then we have to go to the “Pages” section.

4. In the “Build and deployment” section, we will have to select a source for the deployment. In our case we select “Deploy from a branch” in order to deploy the web page configured in a branch from our repository.

5.  After that we just have to select the branch that we want to deploy and click on the “Save” button. In a couple of minutes you will be able to see your web page deployed.

If you want to use a custom domain for your page, please check this [link](https://docs.github.com/es/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) and write your configured domain in the “Custom domain” section. Finally click on the “Save” button.
