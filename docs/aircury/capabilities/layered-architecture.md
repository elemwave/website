# Layered Architecture Capability

Simple layered standards for projects that need clear separation without Clean or Hexagonal overhead

## Framework Rules

## Layered Architecture Rules

### 1. Layer Flow

Use a simple top-down dependency flow:

`controller/route -> service -> repository -> database`

Do not skip layers when the skipped layer owns behaviour.

Forbidden examples:

- Controllers, routes, handlers, or UI server actions querying the database directly for behaviour that belongs in a service.
- Controllers duplicating business rules that should live in services.
- Repositories depending on HTTP request/response objects, UI components, controllers, or transport-specific DTOs.
- Services leaking ORM models or database-specific query details into controllers.

### 2. Layer Responsibilities

Keep responsibilities direct and pragmatic:

- Controllers/routes handle transport concerns: request parsing, shallow input validation, authentication context extraction, status codes, and response shaping.
- Services own application behaviour: business rules, validation that depends on current state, orchestration, transactions, and calls to repositories or external clients.
- Repositories own persistence details: queries, database writes, ORM usage, persistence mapping, and database-specific errors.
- Database/bootstrap code owns concrete client setup, connection management, and migrations.

### 3. Minimal Abstraction

Layered Architecture is the lightweight option. Prefer concrete services and repositories unless an interface is needed for tests, multiple implementations, or a real boundary.

Required approach:

- Keep feature code close together when that improves readability.
- Introduce interfaces only when they remove real coupling or support a known alternate implementation.
- Keep CRUD flows simple when there are no complex domain rules.
- Move logic from controllers into services as soon as it becomes reusable, stateful, or business-specific.

### 4. Escalation Rule

If business rules become complex, infrastructure needs multiple adapters, or the same behaviour must be driven by HTTP, jobs, CLI, events, and tests, consider switching to Clean or Hexagonal Architecture instead of adding ad hoc abstractions.

## Agent Operating Rules

- Use Layered Architecture when selected: keep the flow `controller/route -> service -> repository -> database`, do not let controllers bypass services for business behaviour, and avoid Clean/Hexagonal-style abstractions unless there is a concrete need.
