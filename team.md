    name: "Luis D. Angulo"
    description: >-
        <p>Luis D. Angulo works as associated professor in the Department of Electromagnetics and State Matter Physics, at the University of Granada (Spain). He graduated in Physics in 2007 and obtained his PhD in 2014 with a dissertation title Time Domain Discontinuous Galerkin for Maxwell’s Equations. In 2015 he also graduated in Electronics Engineering.</p>
        <p>During his career has worked mostly in time domain numerical methods applied to electromagnetism, especially discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) and finite differences in time domain (FDTD). He is one of the main developers of Semba, a software tool designed to perform time domain simulations specifically tailored for electromagnetic compatibility problems.  Others of his research interest include the development of meshers suitable to be used with state-of-the-art numerical solvers.</p>
