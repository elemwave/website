# AGENTS.md

## Framework

> Framework-managed section. Add project-specific instructions outside this section.

This project follows the Aircury engineering framework defined in [FRAMEWORK.md](./FRAMEWORK.md).

All agents contributing to this repository MUST read and apply FRAMEWORK.md before doing any work. It is not optional and it is not advisory.

All framework workflow rules, delivery constraints, and enabled standards now live in `FRAMEWORK.md` as the single source of truth.

For this project, `caveman` is already active by default. Start every new session in `caveman full`; do not wait for the user to request `caveman mode`, `/caveman`, or another trigger phrase. Only disable it if the user says `stop caveman` or `normal mode`.

If this repository also has project-specific agent instructions, keep them outside the framework-managed section or in `FRAMEWORK.local.md`, and treat `FRAMEWORK.md` as the governing framework layer.
